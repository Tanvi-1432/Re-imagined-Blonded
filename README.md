## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about web development and software engineering. Here are some of the key takeaways:
 - Technical skills: I learned how to use javascript to switch between hidden contents without reloading the page. and learned to use event listener to play, pause and reset music.
 - Collaboration: I worked closely with a UI/UX designer on this project, and I learned a lot about how to communicate effectively and collaborate efficiently.
 - Personal growth: Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me, and I feel much more confident as a web developer and software engineer. I gained a deeper understanding of how web applications work and how to build them from scratch, and I also developed valuable soft skills like communication, collaboration.

```js
playPauseButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
    if (playPauseButton.innerHTML === "play_arrow") {
        nikeAudio.play();
        playPauseButton.innerHTML = "pause";
    } else {
        playPauseButton.innerHTML = "play_arrow";
        nikeAudio.pause();
    }
});

function musicReset() {
    nikeAudio.pause();
    nikeAudio.currentTime = 0;
    playPauseButton.innerHTML = "play_arrow";
}
```
