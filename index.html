          <p class="about-me">Frank Ocean is a singer-songwriter and member of the hip-hop collective Odd Future.
            <br>
            He's known for his debut mixtape, 'nostalgia, ULTRA,' and the subsequent albums 'channel ORANGE' and

            Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California, on October 28, 1987. He grew up in New Orleans, but moved to
            Los Angeles
            in his late teens
            to pursue a career in music. Ocean started out ghostwriting tracks for such pop stars as Justin Bieber and
            Beyoncé, but
            soon achieved fame as an artist when, in 2011, he released a mixtape of his own music, titled nostalgia,
            ULTRA.

            His next effort, channel ORANGE, was unveiled in 2012 to both critical and popular acclaim, and
